In order to run this project first download the file from Git 
respositorty, by clicking on the Code button. Than click on download
zip file. Once you have downloaded the file click on the folder
open the file with your choice of IDE (Preferrably VScode), 
find package.json folder click on it scroll down so see the 
command you need to run the project than run any terminal 
of your choice, (preferrably Gitbash). Type the command in your terminal
preferrably(npm run dev) to start the project. Wait few seconds than
you will see a URL or link will appear click on that it will open on

Time I have spent for this project to complete:

I have completed this project in precisely 7 hours, first I had to think
on what language and framework I should use than once I have finalized
I went on to find what type of table are out there which will give me
most flexibility with the json data. It was difficult to parse the txt
data to json, I had to prompt ChatGPT that did give me a precise 
array of data. which I did find and implemented in the project. 
I also prompted GPT to give a basic Tailwind design.  
The second and third calendar day all I did 
was optimize the code for better understanding.

Mention the best practices you've implemented in your code:

The project leverages ReactJS, ReactBootstrapTable, and 
Tailwind CSS for implementation. React was selected due 
to its familiarity and comfort, supported by previous 
experience across multiple projects. Its declarative nature 
facilitates code comprehension and maintenance. It was easier to just use
React map function to place the data but later on I had figure out how 
can I make it dynamic which took me an hour on how and where to implement
the dynamic methods.ReactBootstrapTable was chosen for its readability 
and ease of customization, enabling efficient restructuring as required. 
Tailwind CSS complements this by providing a concise and readable syntax, 
streamlining the styling process. This approach aligns with coding 
best practices, emphasizing readability, maintainability, 
and efficient resource utilization throughout the development lifecycle.
